An application developed to help students manage their time and organize their assignments. 
The workload scheduler allows the user to input assignment information such as name, due date, due time, and estimated completion in minutes. 
The application will then output a scheduler that automatically fills in based on available time with work block times.

The external file dependencies were Maven, javafx, and junit. To run the program, open the root
directory in Eclipse, load the maven project from pom.xml, then run Main.java. Our project worked using a model view
controller(mvc).
